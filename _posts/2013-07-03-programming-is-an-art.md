just read here, [Programming is an art](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19692#Programming-is-an-art)

***"
I have been thinking why I love programming and the bottom line is that I love creating stuff. I like to imagine how things can be. Using only a computer I can create anything I can imagine and I can easily share my creations with other people. It's not many professions that enable you this

Allocate 4 hours pr. week where you can create anything you want. Focus on creating. Don't let anybody interrupt you. Move to a cafe. Lock your office. Don't consume. Don't read Hacker News. Don't consume Twitter. Use the 4 hours to create something!

Just keep creative, and do something, you will get more.
